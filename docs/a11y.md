# Accessibility

We built Redwood to make building websites more accessible (_we write all the config so you don't have to_), but Redwood's also built to help you make more accessible websites. Accessibility shouldn't be a nice-to-have. It should be a given from the start, a core feature that's built-in and well-supported.

There's a lot of great tooling out there that'll not only help you build accessible websites, but also help you learn what exactly that means. The framework handles as much as it can for you (via the Redwood Router) and equips you with as many tools as it can (`setup a11y`) for the cases that it can't handle.

> Unequivocally, yes. Even with all the tooling in the world, manual testing's still important, especially for accessibiliy. 
> The GDS Accessibility team found that [automated testing only catches ~30% of all the issues](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/24/what-we-found-when-we-tested-tools-on-the-worlds-least-accessible-webpage).

> But just because the tools don't catch'em all doesn't mean they're not valuable. It'd be much harder to learn what to look for without them.

## Accessible Routing with Redwood Router 

For SPAs, accessibility starts with the Router. Without a full page refresh, you just can't be sure that things are being taken care of the way the're supposed to.

### Announcing Routes

Since there's never a full-page refresh, in SPAs, we have to take care of announcing to user's using screen readers that they've navigated somewhere new. 

Following up on Gatsby's work, Redwood provides a `RouteAnnouncement` component for just that. Whatever the `RouteAnnouncement` wraps will be announced. Note that this can be something on the page, or can be something visually hidden using the `visuallyHidden` prop:

```js
// web/src/pages/HomePage.js

import { RouteAnnouncement } from '@redwoodjs/router'

const HomePage = () => {
  return (
    // this will still be visible
    <RouteAnnouncement>
      <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
    <RouteAnnouncement>
  )
}

export default HomePage 
```

```js
// web/src/pages/AboutPage.js

import { RouteAnnouncement } from '@redwoodjs/router'

const AboutPage = () => {
  return (
    <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
    // this won't be visible
    <RouteAnnouncement visuallyHidden={true}>
      Home
    <RouteAnnouncement>
  )
}

export default AboutPage 
```

If your page doesn't have a `RouteAnnouncement`, Redwood will still announce something. Redwood looks for announcements in this order:

1. `RouteAnnouncement`
2. `h1`
3. `document.title`
4. `location.pathname`

Redwood tries to be as specific as it can, because more specific usually means more descriptive. Note that if you provider mutliple RouteAnnouncements, Redwood will use the most specific one, that way if you have multiple layouts, you can override as needed.

<!-- - todo: multi-nested layouts, or multi-nested RouteAnnouncements at least. -->
<!-- - todo: props: you can use `visuallyHidden` to hide the RouteAnnouncement (reasons for not doing this are... if you want to announce text that's on the screen, you don't want to hide it) -->

#### Announcements

Unfortunately, just because you announced something using `RouteAnnouncement` doesn't mean that you did the right thing. Providing a bad announcement can be worse than providing no announcement at all. You have to take care that what you announced is descriptive so that users can not only orient themselves and navigate through the new content, but also find it again.

https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G88.html

### Managing Focus

Announcing routes is just one half of the equation; the other is managing focus. Using `RouteAnnouncements`, you've let your users know they've navigated somewhere new, but have you setup them up for success when it comes to interacting with that new somewhere?

<!-- Again, to emulate the behvaior of a full-page refresh, focus should be sent to the top of the DOM. But not always. Consider an interactive application... if focus was always being reset, you'd always have to navigate through the DOM to what changed... -->
<!-- That's not to say focus should be left where it was, but that focus should be managed. Just like it's important announce that the page has changed, for continuity, to know that you're somewhere new, it's important to manage focus... so that whatever's new can be interacted with right away. -->

The state of the art says that when you click a link, focus should be sent to a skip link. A skip link is a small interactive element that lets users skip things like navigation and go straight to the main content. Imagine having to tab through the navigation every time you click a link. It suffices to say that it gets cumbersome fast. 

<!-- mention low vision benefits: a skip link also orients users who... -->

Following up on Gatsby's work, Redwood uses [Reach UI's SkipNavLink](https://reach.tech/skip-nav#reach-skip-nav); if you use Redwood's layout generators, you can include it by passing the `--a11y` flag or setting the `generators.a11y` toml key to true:

```js
// web/src/layouts/MainLayout.js

import { RouteFocus, SkipNavLink, SkipNavContent } from '@redwoodjs/router'

const MainLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <>
      // this should be at the top of the page
      <RouteFocus>
        <SkipNavLink />
      </RouteFocus>

      // your nav...

      // this should be right before main
      <SkipNavContent>
      <main>
        {children}
      </main>

      // note that this is also ok
      // <SkipNavContent>
      //   {children}
      // </SkipNavContent>
    </>
  )
}

export default MainLayout
```

The `SkipNavLink` is what gets focused on Route change (note that it's only when you're coming to this page from another&mdash;if you navigate directly there, it won't take focus). On clicking the `SkipNavLink`, focus is sent to the `SkipNavContent`, which...

The SkipNavLink should always come first... it directs focus to the SkipNavContent, which should always come before main...

Using the example from the tutorial:

```js
// web/src/layouts/BlogLayout/BlogLayout.js

import { 
  Link, 
  routes, 
  RouteFocus, 
  SkipNavLink, 
  SkipNavContent 
} from '@redwoodjs/router'

const BlogLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <RouteFocus>
        <SkipNavLink />
      </RouteFocus>
      <header>
        <h1>
          <Link to={routes.home()}>Redwood Blog</Link>
        </h1>
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link to={routes.about()}>About</Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>
      </header>
      <SkipNavContent />
      <main>{children}</main>
    </>
  )
}

export default BlogLayout
```

Note that where it makes sense to do so, Redwood tries to do as much as it can. So using this toml key, you can have Redwood automatically insert skip links into all your layouts:

```
[web]
  insertSkipLinks = true
```

For more on skiplinks, check out [webaim's skipnav](https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/).

<!-- todo: props. -->

#### Skipping more than just the nav

Sometimes you want to skip not just the nav, but maybe straight to something like search. The more specific and interactive your application...

> **Don't overdo it**

> A skip link is supposed to save time. If you include nine skip links, you might need a skip link for your skip links.

## Getting to know the tools

The easiest part is getting setup:

```bash
yarn rw setup a11y
```

Now you're ready to:

- lint with `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`
- develop with `@axe-core/react`
- storybook with `@storybook/addon-a11y`
- test with `jest-axe`

### Linting with `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`

[eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) lints your app for accessibility errors the way eslint lints your app for syntax errors. There's quite a few rules. But `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` has great docs for [every single one](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/tree/master/docs/rules).

<!-- For example, take the [alt-text](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/alt-text.md#alt-text) rule. They provide both good and bad exmaples, and why they're good and bad. -->

All the rules are set to warn. If you want them to error instead, you can run the setup command like this:

```bash
yarn rw setup a11y --set-to-error
```

Now that you've got linting setup, all you have to do now is keep coding!

### Developing with `@axe-core/react`

https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core-npm/tree/develop/packages/react#axe-corereact

[todo]

You can only do so much statically. `@axe-core/react` tests the accessibility of your rendered app. Many accessibility issues exist at the intersection of the DOM and the CSS. Unless you fully render your app, you will get 1) false negatives because of lacking information and 2) false positives because some elements are evaluated in states that aren't final.

### Storybook with `@storybook/addon-a11y`

https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/addons/a11y#storybook-addon-a11y

[todo]

### Testing with `jest-axe`

https://github.com/nickcolley/jest-axe

[todo]

`jext-axe` is an aXe Jest matcher for testing accessibility. It expects the rendered app to have no aXe violations. 

## Testing manually

[todo]

### A few must-have browser extensions

- [axe](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-web-accessibility-tes/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd)
- [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/overview/)
- [ARC Toolkit](https://www.paciellogroup.com/toolkit/)

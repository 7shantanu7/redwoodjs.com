Note: this doc isn't meant to be published and is only an internal note to contributors.

Generally, there's a doc context rule--developing docs go on the website, contributing docs go on the repo. But since the Redwood Router can be used outside Redwood apps, we have to break this rule here, unless we want to face the perils of synchronizing changes across two docs in two places.

So, if you want to edit the Redwood Router doc, go to the repo: https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/master/packages/router/README.md.

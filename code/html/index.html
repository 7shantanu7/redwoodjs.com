<p class="my-4 text-lg">
  Redwood is an opinionated, full-stack, serverless web application framework that will
  allow you to build and deploy JAMstack applications with ease.
</p>
<p class="my-4">
  Imagine a React frontend, statically delivered by CDN, that talks via GraphQL to your
  backend running on AWS Lambdas around the world, all deployable with just a git
  pushâ€”that's Redwood. By making a lot of decisions for you, Redwood lets you get to work
  on what makes your application special, instead of wasting cycles choosing and re-choosing
  various technologies and configurations. Plus, because Redwood is a proper framework, you
  benefit from continued performance and feature upgrades over time and with minimum effort.
</p>

<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Technologies</h2>
<p class="my-4">
  We are obsessed with developer experience and eliminating as much boilerplate as possible.
  Where existing libraries elegantly solve our problems, we use them; where they don't, we
  write our own solutions. The end result is a JavaScript development experience you can
  fall in love with!
</p>
<p class="my-4">
  Here's a quick taste of the technologies a standard Redwood application will use:
</p>

<ul class="my-4 ml-8 list-disc">
  <li>React</li>
  <li>GraphQL (Apollo)</li>
  <li>Prisma</li>
  <li>Storybook</li>
  <li>Babel</li>
  <li>Webpack</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">The Redwood philosophy</h2>
<p class="my-4">
  Redwood believes that JAMstack is a huge leap forward in how we can write web applications
  that are easy to write, deploy, scale, and maintain.
</p>
<p class="my-4">
  Redwood believes that there is power in standards, and makes decisions for you about what
  technologies to use, how to organize your code into files, and how to name things. With a
  shared understanding of the Redwood conventions, a developer should be able to jump into
  any Redwood application and get up to speed very quickly.
</p>
<p class="my-4">
  Redwood believes that traditional, relational databases like PostgresQL and MySQL are
  still workhorses of today's web applications and should be first-class citizens. However,
  that does not mean that Redwood doesn't shine with NoSQL or other types of "web scale"
  databases.
</p>
<p class="my-4">
  Redwood believes that, as much as possible, you should be able to operate in a serverless
  mindset and deploy to a generic computational grid. This helps unlock the next point...
</p>
<p class="my-4">
  Redwood believes that deployment and scaling should be super easy. To deploy your
  application, you should only need to commit and push to your Git repository. To scale
  from zero to thousands of users should not require your intervention. The principles of
  JAMstack make this possible.
</p>
<p class="my-4">
  Redwood believes that it should be equally useful for writing both simple, toy
  applications, and complex, mission critical applications. In addition, it should require
  very little operational work to grow your app from the former to the latter.
</p>
<p class="my-4">
  Redwood believes that you can use JavaScript as your primary language on both the
  frontend and backend. Only needing a single language simplifies everything from code
  reuse to hiring developers.
</p>

<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">How it works</h2>
<p class="my-4">
  A Redwood application is split into two parts: a frontend and a backend. This is
  represented as two node projects within a single monorepo. We use Yarn to make it easy to
  operate across both projects, while still keeping them in a single Git repository.
</p>
<p class="my-4">
  The frontend project is called web and the backend project is called api. For clarity, we
  will refer to these in prose as "sides", i.e. the "web side" and the "api side". They are
  separate projects because code on the web side will end up running in the user's browser
  while code on the api side will run on a server somewhere. It is important that you keep
  this distinction clear in your mind as you develop your application. The two separate
  projects are intended to make this obvious. In addition, separate projects allow for
  different dependencies and build processes for each project.
</p>
<p class="my-4">
  The api side is an implementation of a GraphQL API. Your business logic is organized into
  "services" that represent their own internal API and can be called both from external
  GraphQL requests and other internal services. Redwood can automatically connect your
  internal services with Apollo, reducing the amount of boilerplate you have to write.
  Your services can interact with a database via Prisma's ORM, and Prisma's migration
  tooling provides first-class migrations that take the pain out of evolving your database
  schema.
</p>
<p class="my-4">
  The web side is built with React. Redwood's router makes it simple to map URL paths to
  React "Page" components (and automatically code-split your app on each route). Pages may
  contain a "Layout" component to wrap content. They also contain "Cells" and regular React
  components. Cells allow you to declaratively manage the lifecycle of a component that
  fetches and displays data. Other Redwood utility components make it trivial to implement
  smart forms and various common needs. An ideal development flow starts with Storybook
  entries and Jest tests, so Redwood closely integrates both, making it easy to do the
  right thing.
</p>
<p class="my-4">
  You'll notice that the web side is called "web" and not "frontend". This is because
  Redwood conceives of a world where you may have other sides like "mobile", "desktop",
  "cli", etc, all consuming the same GraphQL API and living in the same monorepo.
</p>
